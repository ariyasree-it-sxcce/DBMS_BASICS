Introduction:

    o Assume There is a Country, the king of the country needs collection of  data
        having the poor people list based on different categories:
        > state wise
        > district wise
        > religion wise
        > income wise
        so it is hard to document it on paper. Inorder to manage those datas by categories we use databases.
        Hence databases help manage categorized data

    o The system that is required to manage those databases are called DBMS[Data Base Management System]
    
Types of Databases:
    o Relational Database
    o NoSQL Database
    o Hierarchical Database
    o Network Database

Introducing SQL:
    
                                                SQL
        DataBase Management System ------------------------------- Database

    o Structured Query Language designed for Relational databases
    o SQL is a language that is used to send requests to access data from Database by DataBase Management System
    o SQL is used to communicate with relational databases through the DBMS.
    O SQL is common to all RDBMS[Relational DataBase Management System]

Types of Relational Database Management System[RDBMS]:
    o Oracle
    o MySQL
    o MS SQL Server
    o PostgreSQL

Types of Data:

    o Structured Data
    o Unstructured Data
    o Semi-Structured Data

    > Structured Data:
        Has defined Structures
        o Ex: Text,Date,Name
    > Unstructured Data: 
        Different type of Structures like Reels,Comments,Posts,Likes
        o Ex: Social Media Platform like Facebook,Pinterest,Youtube
    > Semi-Structured Data
        o Structured Data + Unstructured Data 
        o Ex: Email,WhatsApp

Relational and Non-Relational Database:
    |
    |
    Relational Database:
        > It is Structured Database[Table Format] for organization of data
        > It uses SQL [Structured Query Language] to work with
    Non-Relational Database
        > Here we don't use SQL that is it uses NoSQL
        > Data will be in the form Graph,Key-Value Pair,Column,Row,Documents.
